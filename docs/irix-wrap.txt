        Here is a funny one: WWW HTTP/1.0 Server, as shipped with
        IRIX 6.2 (at least in low end machines) includes a perl
        script (wrap) which allows anyone on the net to get a
        listing for any directory with mode +755.


        Simply use

        http://sgi.victim/cgi-bin/wrap?/../../../../../etc

        (for instance)

        There is a nice interface to this bug at
