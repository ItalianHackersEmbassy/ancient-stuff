The actual vulnerability is quite ugly.  netprint has system("disable")
call, i.e. it calls a program without specifying absolute path.  At the
moment the call is made, uid=lp.  So lp priorities can be trivially
obtained.

/usr/lib/print/netprint -n blah -h blah -p blah 1-234

and whatever program named  disable  is first in the PATH will be executed
as lp.

However, one can go further if BSD printing subsystem is installed.
/usr/spool/lpd is owned by lp, and it's the place where lpd writes lock
file.  lpd is also root/suid.  So one replaces
/usr/spool/lpd/lpd.lock with a symlink to /etc/passwd and runs lpd, passwd
gets nuked.  Then one repeats netprint trick, and, voila, disable now runs
as root, because lp is not found in passwd.  Kinda neat.
