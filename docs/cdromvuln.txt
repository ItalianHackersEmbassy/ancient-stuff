This effects Slackware 3.0 and possibly other distributions, I haven't 
checked others yet.

If you mount the CDROM, it is mounted SUID-enabled. This is bad as many 
CDs include things such as the live filesystem on the Slackware CD. Thus, 
all a cracker has to do is run /cdrom/live/usr/bin/splitvt or exploit some 
other horrible old SUID-bug and root is obtained.

Fix this by changing the line in /etc/fstab which reads:
/dev/cdrom    /cdrom  iso9660    ro  1  1
to read:
/dev/cdrom    /cdrom  iso9660 nosuid  ro 1 1
to fix, and then
umount /cdrom ; mount /cdrom
to activate
