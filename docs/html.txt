	Many systems run a service called "chargen" on port 19. It simply
	generates a never-ending stream of characters.

	If an MSIE or Lynx user connects to a chargen, the browser will act as
	though viewing a file of infinite length. This has caused a modem
	connection to drop using MSIE, and slowed a Linux system using lynx to a
	crawl due to exhaustion of memory. Both processes were aborted before any
	further damage was caused.

	A URL such as http://localhost:19 could cause the "flooding" damage to a
	system running lynx and chargen to occur almost instantly, because the
	characters would of course come at a much higher speed.

	The CHARGEN service has other security implications and should be turned
	off in normal system operation.

	You can also create a serios DOS attack when this is combined with a proxy
	server.  Using the URL:

	http://some.proxy.host/http://some.host.on.the.local.lan:19/

	can bring some machines to a screaming halt.

Even simple HTML can cause problems. This one is great with NT web client users:
