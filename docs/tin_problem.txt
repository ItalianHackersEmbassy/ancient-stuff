Small bug I discovered in the unix NEWS reader tin/rin.

When a user runs rtin/tin a user-list will be created in /tmp/.tin_log
with mode 0666. and if a user makes a symlink from /etc/passwd (or any
file) to /tmp/.tin_log and root or another user with uid 0 runs rtin/tin,
tin will follow the symlink to /etc/passwd and change the mode to 0666.

I hope no admin's are stupid enough to run rtin/tin as uid 0. :-)


=========================================================================

To fix add or change this line in Makefile:
COPTS = -c -O -DDONT_LOG_USER
and recompile rtin/tin package.
