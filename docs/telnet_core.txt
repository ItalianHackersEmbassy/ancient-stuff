In Linux you can get the part of the passwd file with the cores.
1)To do this open 2 telnet
2)on one of the telnet sessions get into your host and type /bin/login
3)then put as login root and a wrong passwd (you can do this with any account)
leave it open
4)on the other telnet session type ps auwx | grep login
5)check the proccess number and then type kill -11 proccessname
6)on the other term you should get login: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
7)on the term you got that type strings core > woah
that should get ya to the unshadowed porcion of the root login
