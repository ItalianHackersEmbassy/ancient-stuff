Recently I noticed that one can discover what files any machine contains
so long as rpc.mountd on that machine has permissions to read it.
rpc.mountd usually runs as root, so this is pottentially a severe
vulnerability.

Here's what happens.  If I try to mount /etc/foobar on my Linux box (this
has been tested with Ultrix also), and /etc/foobar does not exist, I get
this error:

slartibartfast:~# mount slarti:/etc/foobar /mnt
mount: slarti:/etc/foobar failed, reason given by server: No such file or
directory
slartibartfast:~#

If the file does exist, and I don't have permission to read it, I get this
error:

slartibartfast:~# mount slarti:/etc/passwd /mnt
mount: slarti:/etc/passwd failed, reason given by server: Permission denied
slartibartfast:~#

Thus, by process of elemination, one can discover what software packages
are installed (shadow, etc), in many cases what versions (such as
sperl5.001), and thereby discover many security vulnerabilities without
ever having logged on to the machine, and often only generating the log
message:

Aug 24 06:57:30 slartibartfast mountd[7220]: Access by unknown NFS client
10.9.8.2.

which doesn't emphasize the seriousnous of this attack.

It has been confirmed that this hole is present on at least
some distributions/versions of Linux, Ultrix, NetBSD, OpenBSD, SunOS,
Solaris, and probably many many more.

This was solved well before 2.1 OPENBSD shipped.  The problem did exist in
2.0, but that's about a year old now, and has been replaced with 2.1.

Here's the log entry:

        OPENBSD_2_1: 1.16.0.2

Stop info gathering attack pointed out by Alan Cox-
Only return ENOENT if the dir trying to be mounted is really exported
to the client.  Return EACCESS if not exported.

This works with AIX 3.2.5 and 4.1.4 too.
