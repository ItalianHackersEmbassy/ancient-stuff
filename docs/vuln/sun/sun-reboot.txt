How to reboot a sun ultra running solaris 2.5.1 from the
console, when being logged in as a normal user, without touching
STOP-A. (tested on ultra1 140m)

Try executing

perl -e 'print "\e[1J"'

on the console without starting X11. This will send your ultra
to kingdom come and only a power-on reset can get it back ...

Now why do I care?

Because some of our users like to telnet to a VAX system from the sun
console without starting up X11.  On the VAX they use their favorite editor,
which uses above escape sequence to clear the screen. Unfortunately the
screen clearing is a bit to effective on a ultra.

The Bug is in the Sun bug-database under ID 4039619 (that is the number
quoted by our sun service rep) The workaround according to sun is:
"Don't log into the VAX without starting X." Obvious yes ... thank you ...

bad trap and panic induced on :-

SunOS xxx 5.5.1 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1

It was confirmed to be a problem by our sun service
contact. They said they could reproduce it ... You must make sure
that you are trying this on a Sun Graphics Board Connected Monitor,
which is NOT running X11 (OpenWindows). This Problem does not
manifest itself on tty connected Terminals. Or when running X11.
