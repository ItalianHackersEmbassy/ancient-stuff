   There may exists a vulnerability in the lquerypv command under AIX.
I'am not sure what version yet. Please try to fallowing command:

/usr/sbin/lquerypv -h /etc/security/passwd

   You can substitute /etc/security/passwd for any other unreadable file.
If the program is able to dump the file (maybe in hex) you got a problem.
Please email me what version of AIX you are running, patch level, and if
you are vulnerable. I will summarize the resuls and post them to the list.
