          In the default setup for irix boxes, xhost
is set to global access whenever someone logs in on console (or invokes
xdm).  There may be some good reason for this default behavior, however
it's often a nuissance in situations where one is around a lot of immature
ppl just waiting to xdisplay '/usr/bin/X11/endsession -f' to your console.

This system-wide default is set in config files residing in /var/X11/xdm
You will probably need to edit the files:
        Xsession
        Xsession.dt
        Xsession-remote
But to be sure, just grep for xhost, and change it to 'xhost -' where
needed.
