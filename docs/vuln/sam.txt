While looking in the /var/tmp directory I noticed a file called "outdata".
After some experiments, I discovered that this file is written to by sam
when the user selects "Networking and Communication" followed by
"Internet Addresses" or "Network Information Service" (and probably others
too).

So, if I make a symbolic link from /var/tmp/outdata to
/.rhosts (say), and wait for the sys-admin to run sam to configure
networking, I can get a /.rhosts file. Admittedly this isn't too
interesting as the file doesn't have the famous "+ +" in it. However,
if your sysadmin happens to have umask set to 0 then you've now got a
world writable /.rhosts file. (This isn't as unusual as it sounds, try an
rlogin to a remote host running HP-UX and check your umask. Chances are
it's 00).

You've certainly got a case for a very potent DoS.  Link to any file you want:
/bin/sh, /etc/passwd, /bin/login, etc. and *poof* there it goes.
