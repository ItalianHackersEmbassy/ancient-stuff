It's a very very old hole in /bin/mail that allows race conditions in
which .rhosts files can be created...

I would have thought this was fixed by 2.5, but it wasn't. My boss just a
few minutes ago exploited it on a sol2.5 machine.

===========================================================================
                [8lgm]-Advisory-5.UNIX.mail.24-Jan-1992

PROGRAM:

        binmail(1)        (/usr/bin/mail)

VULNERABLE OS's:

        SunOS 4.1.x

        (Possibly other platforms - see DISCUSSION)

DESCRIPTION:

        A race condition exists in binmail(1), which allows files to
        be created in arbitrary places on the filesystem.  These files
        can be owned by arbitrary (usually system) users.

IMPACT:

        Any user with access to binmail(1) can become root.

REPEAT BY:

        This example demonstrates how to become root on most affected
        machines by creating/appending-to root's .rhosts file.  Please
        do not do this unless you have permission.

        Create the following file, 'mailscript':

8<--------------------------- cut here ----------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# Syntax: mailscript user target-file rsh-user
#
# This exploits a flaw in SunOS binmail(1), and attempts
# to become the specified 'user', by creating a .rhosts
# file and using rsh.
#
# Written 1992 by [8LGM]
# Please do not use this script without permission.

        (Lines marked with > represent user input)

Check what root users are on the system:

>       % grep :0: /etc/passwd
        root:*:0:1:Operator:/:/bin/csh
        sysdiag:*:0:1:Old System Diagnostic:/usr/diag/sysdiag:/usr/diag/sysdiag/sysdiag
        sundiag:*:0:1:System Diagnostic:/usr/diag/sundiag:/usr/diag/sundiag/sundiag
        +::0:0:::

We choose a user with UID 0, but without a /var/spool/mail/<username> file:

>       % ls -l /var/spool/mail/sysdiag
        /var/spool/mail/sysdiag not found

Execute mailscript.  The user is sysdiag, the target file is /.rhosts, and
the user to rsh to on success is root:

>       % chmod 700 mailscript
>       % ./mailscript sysdiag /.rhosts root
        mailscript: Warning, /.rhosts already exists, appending
        Sending mail to sysdiag
        We won the race, becoming root
        ./mailscript: 11051 Killed
        #

DISCUSSION:

        This problem exists because /var/spool/mail is rwxrwxrwt. (Other
        systems have their spool dir rwxrwxr-x, and run their MUA's sgid
         mail).  Before it opens the mail file, binmail does an lstat(2)
        to check that it is not about to write to a linked file.  The
        intention is to prevent arbitrary files from being created or
        appended to.

        However, there exists a window of opportunity between lstat(2)
        and open(2); if a link is created after lstat, open will then
        follow the link.  This is not a straightforward task, as it is
        not possible to predict when to create the link.

        Therefore it is necessary to have a program (mailrace) which
        continually creates links and then removes them.  To exploit the
        window of opportunity, it is required that the link has been
        removed before the context switch for lstat, but exists for open.
        There are three possible outcomes for this race:-

        1) lstat finds a link - mail returned to sender.

        2) link does not exist for lstat, but does for open - file
           created - we win.

        3) link does not exist for lstat or open - mailbox created.
           In this case, it is not possible to remove the mailbox
           (as the stick bit is set on /var/spool/mail), so it is
           necessary to choose another target user.

        In tests, it would appear that the chances of 1) and 2)
        occurring are approximately equal, with the chance of 3) being
        somewhat lower.

        Please note that this vulnerability may exist on other
        platforms where the mail spool directory has mode 777 and
        /bin/mail is setuid root.

WORKAROUND & FIX:

        1. Contact your vendor for a patch.

        2. We have considered several potential workarounds for this
           vulnerability.  The ideal fix would be to remove global write
           access to the mail spool directory.  However, this is not
           possible as programs such as /bin/mail, /usr/ucb/Mail and
           elm require everyone to have write access.  Also it is not
           possible to, for example, change the group ownership of
           /var/spool/mail to mail and give /bin/mail and /usr/ucb/Mail
           setgid mail privilege, as they do not reset their group id
           before forking a shell.

           We have therefore decided that the following is the only
           viable method:

           i. Ensure that every user maintains a mailbox file.  The
              following program will create a mailbox for every user
              on the system, if one does not currently exist.

           ii. /usr/ucb/Mail removes the mailbox file if all mail has
               been read, and the user is not preserving the contents.
               Therefore, we would recommend using the following wrapper
               for Mail, which creates the user's mailbox if it has been
               removed.
